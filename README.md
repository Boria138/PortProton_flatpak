## ðŸ’» Installation

### From FlatHub

   ```sh
   flatpak install flathub com.castrofidel.portproton
   ```
   
### From Bundle

```sh
flatpak install portproton.flatpak
flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.GL32.default org.winehq.Wine.gecko org.winehq.Wine.mono org.gnome.Platform.Compat.i386 org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg-full org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg_full.i386
```

If you used nvidia install **org.freedesktop.Platform.GL32.nvidia**

## Running
Launch PortProton from your desktop menu, or via command line:

```sh
flatpak run com.castrofidel.portproton
```

Or add an alias that allows you to call PortProton using the `portproton` alias:

```sh
echo "alias portproton='flatpak run com.castrofidel.portproton'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

**You will need to source the updated file with`~/.bashrc` or restart any terminal emulators you have open for the alias to take effect.**

## ðŸ”¨ Building

To compile PortProton as a Flatpak, you'll need both [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup/) and [Flatpak Builder](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder.html) installed. Once you manage that, do the following...

```sh

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform.Compat.i386 org.freedesktop.Platform.GL32.default org.winehq.Wine.mono org.winehq.Wine.gecko org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg-full org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg_full.i386

./build.sh
```
